## I Have a Question

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for [existing issues](https://github.com/vincentscode/kde-dolphin-snapshots-pane/issues) that might help you.
In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue.

If you do not find a matching issue, you can [open a new one](https://github.com/vincentscode/kde-dolphin-snapshots-pane/issues/new) to ask your question.
Please provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
Include project and platform versions, depending on what seems relevant.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors.
If you run into an issue with the project, you can report it by [opening an issue](https://github.com/vincentscode/kde-dolphin-snapshots-pane/issues/new).

Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report.
